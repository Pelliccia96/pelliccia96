## Welcome to Francesco Pelliccia's GitHub page! 🔥

Hi! My name is *Francesco* and I'm a _Full-Stack Web Developer_.

My passion for technology and my high motivation for constant personal growth have led me to find a home in the Coding World, where you have the continuous opportunity to learn, grow and improve.
I love programming in JavaScript and Php and I love spending my time learning new things about IT.

_If it's about coding, I'm in!_
